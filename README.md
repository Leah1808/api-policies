  1. Its maintenance and development is handled by the developer of it.
  2. It doesn't go through the official development lifecycle, i.e., it's not tested and maintained like the transports and modules that are part of the official releases.
  3. Defects and enhancement requests have to be reported through the module's Github page.
  4. Issues on it are unlikely to be escalated to MuleSoft's Sustaining team because of the above mentioned items.
